    <h1 class="font-effect-3d"> Basic Practices Of Crop Production </h1>
    <p> Cultivation of crops involves several activities undertaken by farmers over a period of time. You may find that these activities are similar to those carried out by a gardener or even by you when you grow ornamental plants in your house. These activities or tasks are referred to as <b> Agricultural Practices </b> whic are listed below: </p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li> Preparation Of Soil </li>
        <li> Sowing </li>
        <li> Adding Manure And Fertilizers </li>
        <li> Irrigation </li>
        <li> Protecting From Weeds </li>
        <li> Harvesting </li>
        <li> Storage </li>

        <dt class="stepterm1"> <b> Preparation Of Soil </b> </dt>
        
        <dd> 
            <p> The preparation of soil is the first step before growing a crop. One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to turn the soil and loosen it. This alows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The loose soil allows the roots to breathe easily even when they go deep into the soil. </p> 
            <p> The loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworms and microbes present in the soil. These organisms are friends of the farmer since they further turn and loosen the soil and add humus to it. </p>
            <p> We know that soil contains minerals, water, air & some living organisms. In addition, dead plants and animals get decomposed by soil organisms. In this way, various nutrients in the dead organisms are released back into the soil. These nutrients are again absorbed by plants. </p>
            <p> Since only a few centimeters of the top layer of soil supports plant growth, turning and loosening of soil brings the nutrient rich soil to the top so that plants can use these nutrients. Thus, turning and loosening of soil is very important for cultivation of crops </p>
            <p> The process of loosening and turning of the soil is called <b> Tilling </b> or <b> Ploughing </b>. This is done by using a plough. Ploughs are made of wood or iron. If the soil is very dry, it may need watering before ploughing. The ploughed field may have big clumps of soil called <b> crumbs </b>. It is necessary to break these crumbs. Levelling the field is beneficial for sowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling of soil is done with the help of a <b> Leveller </b>. </p>
            <p> Sometimes, manure is added to the  soil before tilling. This helps in proper mixing of manure with the soil. The soil is moistened before sowing. </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2 class="hex"> Agricultural Implements </h2>
    <p class="hexdata"> Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to break <b> Soil Clumps </b> to get better yield. This is done with the help of various tools. The main tools used for this purpose are <b> Plough, Hoe & Cultivator </b>. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt class="miniterm1"> Plough </dt>
        <dd class="minidata1"> This is being used since ancient times for tilling the soil, adding fertilisers to the crop, removing the weeds & turning the soil. This is made of wood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or other animals [Horses & Camels]. It contains a strong triangular iron strip called <b> Ploughshare </b>. The main part of the plough is a long log of wood which is called a <b> Ploughshaft </b>. There is a handle at one end of the shaft. The other end is attached to a beam which ias placed on the bulls' necks. One pair of bulls and a man can easily operate the plough </dd>
        
        <dt class="miniterm2"> Hoe </dt>
        <dd class="minidata2"> It is a simple tool which is used for removing weeds and for loosening the soil. It has a long rod of wood or iron. A strong, broad and bent plate of iron is fixed to kon eof its ends and works like a blade. It is pulled by animals. </dd>

        <dt class="miniterm3"> Cultivator </dt>
        <dd class="minidata3"> Nowadays, plough is done by tractor-driven cultvator. The use of cultivator saves labour and time. </dd>

    <dl>
        <dt class="stepterm2"> <b> Sowing </b> </dt>

        <dd> 
         Sowing is an important part of crop production. Before sowing, good quality, clean & healthy seeds of a good variety-are selected. Farmers prefer to use seeds which give high yield. 
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2 class="selection"> Selection Of Seeds </h2>
    <p class="activity1"> Take a beaker and fill half of it with water. Put a handful of wheat seeds and stir well. Wait for some time. </p>
    <p> Are there seeds which float on water ? Would those be lighter or heavier than those which sink ? Why would they bew lighter ? Damaged seeds become hollow and are thus lighter. Therefore, they float on water. </p>
    <p> This is a good method for seperating good, healthy seeds from the damaged ones. </p>
    <p> Before sowing, one of the important tasks is to know about the tools used for sowing seeds. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt class="sowingtool1"> <b> Traditional Tool </b> </dt>
        <dd class="sowingtooldefinition1"> The tool used traditionally for sowing seeds is shaped like a funnel. The seeds are filled into the funnel, passed down through two or three pipes having sharp ends. These ends pierce into the soil and place seeds there. </dd>
        
        <dt class="sowingtool2"> <b> Seed Drill </b> </dt>
        <dd class="sowingtooldefinition2"> Nowadays, the seed drill is used for sowing with the help of tractors. This sows the seeds uniformly at equal distance and depth. It ensures that seeds get covered by the soil after sowing. This protects seeds from being eaten by birds. Sowing by seed drill saves time and labour. </dd>

        <p class="paheliA1"> Seeds of a few plants such as Paddy are first grown in a nursery. When they grow into seedlings, they are <br> transplanted to the field manually. Some forest plants and flowering plants are also grown in the nursery. </p>

        <p> Appropriate distance between the seeds is necessary to avoid <b> Overcrowding </b> of plants. This allows plants to get sufficient sunlight, nutrients & water from thew soil. Atntimes, a few plants may have to be removed to prevent overcrowding. </p>
        <dl>
            <dt class="stepterm3"> <b> Adding Manure & Fertilisers </b> </dt>
            <dd>
                <p> The substances which are added to the soil in the form of nutrients fer the healthy growth of the plants are cakled <b> Manure & Fertilisers </b>. </p>
                <p> Soil supplies minerals & nutrients to the crop plants . These nutrients are essential for the growth of plants. In certain areas, farmers grow cropm after crop in the same field. The field is never left uncultivated or fallow. </p>
                <p> Continuous cultivation of crops makes the soil poor in nutrients. Therefore, farmers have to add manure to the fields to replenish the soil witrh nutrients. This process is called manuring. Improper or insufficient manuring results in weak plants. </p>
                <p> Manure is an organic substance obtained from the decomposition of plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump plant and animal wastes in pits at open places and allow it to decompose. The decomosition is caused by some micro-organisms. The decomposed matter is used as organic manure. </p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="activity2"> Take moong or gram seeds and germinate them. Take three empty glasses or similar vessels. Mark them A, B & C. To glass A, add little amount of soil mixed with a little cow dung. In glass B, add the same amount of soil mixed with a little urea. Take the same amount of soil in glass C without adding anything. Now pour the same amount of water in each glass and plant theseedlings in them. Keep them in a safe place and water them daily. After 7 to 10 days, observe their growth. </p>
        <p> Did plants in all the glasses grow at he same pace ? Which glass showed better growth of plants ? In which glass was the growth fastest ? </p>
        <p> Fertilisers are chemicals which are rich in a particular nutrient. But they are different from manure. Fertilisers are produced in factories. Some examples of fertilisers are - Urea, Ammonium Sulphate, Super Phosphate, Potash, N.P.K. [ Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium ]. </p>
        <p> The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops such as Wheat, Paddy & Maize. But excessive use of fertilisers has made the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also become a source of water pollution. Therefore, in order to maintain, the fertility of the soil, we have to substitute fertilisers with orvanic manure or leave the field uncultivated [ Fallow ] in between two crops. </p>
        <p> The use of manure improves soil texture as well as its water retaining capacity. It replenishes the soil with nutrients. </p>
        <p> Another method of replenishing the soil with nutrients is through <b> Crop Rotation </b>. This can be done by growing different crops alternately. Earlier farmers in northern India used to grow legumes as fodder in one season and Wheat in the next season. This helped in the replenishment of the soil with nitrogen. Farmers are being encouraged to adopt thisx practice. </p>
        <p> In the nodules of roots of leguminous plants, a bacteria named <b> Rhizobium </b> is present which helps in fixing atmospheric nitrogen </p>

            <dt class="stepterm4"> <b> Irrigation </b> </dt>
            <dd>
                <p> All living beings need water to live. Water is important for proper growth and development. Water is absorbed by the plant roots. Along with water, minerals and fertilisers are also absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90% water. Water is essential because germination of seeds does not take place under dry conditions. Nutrients dissolved in water are transported to each part of the plant. Water also protects the crop from both frost & hot air currents. To maintain the moisture of the soil for healthy crop growth, fields have to be watered regularly. </p>
                <p> The supply of water to crops at regular intervals is called <b> Irrigation </b>. The time and frequency of irrigation varies from crop to crop, soil to soil & season to season. In summer, the frequency of watering is higher. </p>
            </dd>
            <dt class="source"> <b> Sources of irrigation </b> </dt>
            <dd> The sources for water for irrigation are - wekls, tubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, dams & canals </dd>
        </dl>
        <h2> Traditional Methods Of Irrigation </h2>
        <p> The water available in wells, lakes & canals is lifted up by different methods in different regions, for taking it to the fields. Cattle or human labour is used in these methods. So these methods are cheaper, but less efficient. <br> The various traditional ways are: </p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li> Moat [Pulley-System] </li>
            <li> Chain Pump </li>
            <li> Dekhli </li>
            <li> Rahat [Lever System] </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Pumps are commonly used for lifting water. Diesel, Biogas, Electricity & Solar energy are used to run these Pumps. </p>
        <h2> Modern Methods Of Irrigation </h2>
        <p> Modern methods of irrigation help us to use water economically. <br> The main methods used are as follows: </p>
        <dl>
            <dt class="way1"> (i) Sprinkler System </dt>
            <dd> This system is more useful on the uneven land where sufficient water is not available. The perendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on the top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is allowed to flow through the main pipe under pressure with the help of a pump, it escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining. Sprinkler is very useful for lawns coffee plantations and several other crops. </dd>
                  
            <dt class="way1"> (ii) Drip System </dt>
            <dd> In this system, the water falls drop by drop directly near the roots. So it is called <b> Drip System  </b>. It is the best technique for watering fruit plants, gardens & trees. water is not wasted at all. It is a boon in regions where availability of water is poor. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
            <dt class="stepterm5"> Protection From Weeds </dt>
            <dd>    
                <p> In a field, other undesirable plants may grow naturally along with the crop. These undesirable plants are called <b> weeds </b>. </p>
                <p> The removal of weeds is called weeding. Weeding is necessary since weeds compete with the crop plants for water, nutrients, space & light. Thus, they affect the growth of the crop. Some weeds interfere even in <b> Harvesting </b> and may be poisonous for animals and human beings. </p>
                <p> Farmers adopt many ways to remove weeds and control their growth. Tilling before sowing of crops helps in uprooting & killing of weeds, which may then dry up and get mixed with the soil. The best time for the removal of weeds is before they produce flowers and seeds. The manual removal includes physical removal of weeds by uprooting or cutting them close to the ground, from time to time. This is done with the helpof a <em> Khurpi </em>. A Seed Drill is also used to uproot weeds. </p>    
                <p> Weeds are also controlled by using certain chemicals, called <b> Weedicides </b>, like 2, 4-D. These are sprayed in the fields to kill the weeds. They do not damage the crops.The weedicides are diluted with water to the extent required and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer. </p>
                <p> As already mentioned, the weedicides are sprayed during the vegetative growth of the weeds before flowering and seed formation. Spraying of weedicides may affect the health of the farmers. So they should use these chemicals very carefully. They should cover their nose and mouth with a piece of cloth during spraying of these chemicals. </p>

        <dl>
            <dt class="stepterm6"> <b> Harvesting </b> </dt>
            <dd> 
                <p> Harvesting of crops is an important task. The cutting of crop after it is mature is called <b> Harvesting </b>. In harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut close to the ground. It usually takes 3-4 months for a cereal crop to mature. </p>
                <p> Harvesting in our country is either done manually by a <b> sickle </b> or by a machine called <b> Harvester </b>. In the harvested crop, the grain seeds need to be seperated from the Chaff. This process is called <b> Threshing </b>. This is carried out with the help of a machine called 'Combine' which is in fact a Harvester as well as a Thresher. </p>
                <p> Farmers with small holdings of land do the seperation of grain and chaff by <b> Winnowing </b>. </p>
            </dd>
        </dl>
    <div class="festive">
        <h2> Harvest Festivals </h2>
        <p> After three or four months of hard work, there comes the day of the harvest. The sight of golden fields of standing crop, laden with grain, fills the hearts of farmers with joy and a sense of well-being. The efforts of the past season have borne fruit and it is time to relax and enjoy a little. The period of harvest is, thus, of great joy and happiness in all parts of India. Men and women celebrate it with great enthusiasm. Special festivals associated with the harvest season are <b> Pongal, Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya & Bihu </b>. </p>
    </div>
    <dl>
        <dt class="stepterm7"> <b> Storage </b> </dt>
        <dd> 
            <p> Storage of produce is an important task. If the harvested grains are to be kept for longer time, they should be safe from moisture, insects, rats and micro-organisms. Harvested grains have more moisture. If freshly harvested grains (seeds) are stored without drying, they may get spoilt or attacked by organisms, making them unfit for use or for germination. Hence, before storing them, the grains are properly dried in the sun to reduce the moisture in them. This prevents the attack by insect pests, bacteria and fungi. </p>    
            <p> Farmers store grains in jute bags or metallic bins. However, large scale storage of grains is done in <b> silos </b> and <b> granaries </b> to protect them from pests like rats and insects. </p>
            <p> Dried neem leaves are used for storing food grains at home. For storing large quantities of grains in big godowns, specific chemical treatments are required to protect them from pests and micro-organisms. </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2> Food From Animals </h2>
    <p> Like plants, animals also provide us with different kinds of food. Many people living in the coastal areas consume fish as a major part of their diet. We have just seen that the process of crop production involves a number of steps like selection of seeds, sowing, etc. Similarly, animals reared at home or in farms, have to be provided with proper food, shelter & care. When this is done on a large scale, it is called <b> Animal Husbandry </b>. </p>
